# baking-pi-in-c
A guide to make Operating System on Raspberry Pi in C.

# Introduction
Cambridge University Tutorials are excellently written tutorials on Operating System Development on Raspberry Pi. However, they start from assembler using arm assembly rather than C. We have simply mimic their tutorials here, but using C instead of assembler. The C compiler simple converts C syntax to assembly and then assembles this into executable code for us anyway.

The reason for doing this work is obvious. Firstly, Raspberry Pi is about software development. Secondly writing code in any high level language is much easier as compare to writing code in assembly. Furthermore, by doing this we will be able to provide a platform to operating system hobbyist to implement their own Operating Systems on Raspberry in C language.
